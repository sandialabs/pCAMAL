This directory (./bisected) contains source code to covert a ExodusII file
written by Cubit to a form that pCAMAL understands. (See the file description
in ../file_format.txt.)

The following steps will build the program in a separate directory.

1) mkdir build

2) cd build

3) ccmake ../src
	select the desired options and configure; I use the values below:
	PCAMAL_DIR = /home/mbsteph/pcamal
	PCAMAL_OS = Linux

4) make

You should now have the executable bisected-file in the build directory.

To generate the input file for bisected-file, execute the following commands
in ./src.

1) cubit -nographics -batch bisected_cyl.pcamal.jou

You should now have the ExodusII file bisected_cyl.pcamal.g in the src
directory.

2) cp bisected_cyl.g ../build

Finally, generate the pCAMAL file in the build directory.

1) bisected-file -f bisected_cyl.g -o bisected_cyl.pcamal.g

bisected_cyl.pcamal.g should be equivalent to
../../bisected_cyl.pcamal.g except for date and time generated.

bisected_cyl.pcamal.g is the input to the pcamal_test program in the directory
./pcamal_test.
