Design objective: The goal of this design is an Exodus II file that will 
support data transfer of multiple, sweepable volumes from Cubit to pCamal
for meshing.

Requirements:
1. File is in Exodus II format
2. File contains all information necessary to sweep each volume, i.e.,
   points, boundary elements identified as source surface(s), linking surface,
   and target surface.
3. File contains node sets and side sets used to define boundary conditions
