Design objective: The goal of this design is an Exodus II file that will 
support data transfer of multiple, sweepable volumes from Cubit to pCamal
for meshing.

Requirements:
1. File is in Exodus II format
2. File contains all information necessary to sweep each volume, i.e.,
   points, boundary elements identified as source surface(s), linking surface,
   and target surface.
3. File contains node sets and side sets used to define boundary conditions

Information data
----------------
N/A

Nodal coordinates
-----------------
for all coordinates on boundary surface of all sweepable volumes
  x, y, z 

Node number map
---------------
for each internal ID
  Cubit node number

Element number map
------------------
N/A

Optimized element order map
---------------------------
N/A

Element blocks
--------------
Element block ID:	unique ID assigned by Cubit
Element type:		SHELL
Number of elements:	number of quads on boundary of this sweepable volume
Nodes per element:	4
Number of attributes:	0

Element Connectivity:
for all elements in this sweepable volume
  n1, n2, n3, n4

Element Attributes:     N/A

Node sets
---------
Node set ID:		unique ID assigned by Cubit (num. blocks node sets)
			(additional node sets defined by user)
Number of nodes:	number of nodes on boundary of this sweepable volume
Number of distribution factors: 0

Node set node list
for each node  on boundary of this sweepable volume
  internal ID of nodes

Node set distribution factors: N/A

Side sets
---------
Side set ID:		unique ID assigned by Cubit (num. blocks x 3 side sets)
			(additional side sets defined by user)
Number of sides:	number of quads on boundary of this sweepable volume
Number of distribution factors: 0

Side set element list
for each element on boudnary of this sweeable volume
  internal element id 

Side set side list
for each element on boundary of this sweepable volume
  1 (face of shell element)

Side set distribution factors
-----------------------------
N/A


Object properties
-----------------
Name	EB1	...	EBn	NS1	...	NSn	SS1	SS2	SS3	...	SSm
ID	1	...	n	1	...	n	1	2	3		m
SweepID	5	...	3	5	...	3	5	5	5		3
SurfType						1	2	3	...	3

The SweepID identifies the element block, node set, and side sets associated
with each sweepable block. Blocks and sets of the same sweepable volume will
have the same value, e.g., 5.

The SurfaceType identifies the side sets as source (1), linking (2) or
target (3) elements.
