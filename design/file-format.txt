Design objective: The goal of this design is an Exodus II file that will 
support data transfer of multiple, sweepable volumes from Cubit to pCamal
for meshing.

Requirements:
1. File is in Exodus II format
2. File contains all information necessary to sweep each volume, i.e.,
   points, boundary elements identified as source surface(s), linking surface,
   and target surface.
3. File may contain additional element blocks,  node sets and side sets 
   defined by the user.

The description below is for the pCAMAL specific items in the Exodus file.

Object properties
-----------------
for each pCAMAL element block, define the following object properties
  _CU_SweepID1
  _CU_SweepID2
  _CU_SurfaceType1
  _CU_SurfaceType2
  _CU_NumberHexes1
  _CU_NumberHexes2
  _CU_UserBlockNo1
  _CU_UserBlockNo2
  _CU_NodesPerHex1
  _CU_NodesPerHex2

The _CU_SweepID identifies the element blocks associated with each sweepable
volume. Blocks in the same sweepable volume will have the same value, e.g.,
1, 2, etc.

The _CU_SurfaceType identifies the element blocks as source (1), target (2)
or linking (3) elements.

The two sweep id and two surface type properties allow for sharing of surfaces
between sweepable volumes without duplicating elements. Two are sufficient
since no more than two volumes should share a surface quad.

The _CU_NumHexes gives the number of elements generated from the source
surface, i.e., the number of source elements times the number of layers from
that source to the target surface. The second instance gives the value for
the source surface if it is the source for two volumes with opposite
sweep directions. The number of hexes is used for load balancing.

The _CU_UserBlockNo gives the block number assigned to this block by the user.
If the user does not assign block numbers, the default block number (ID) is
used for this block.

The _CU_NodesPerHex gives the number of nodes per hexahedral element for this
block. A HEX8 element has 8 nodes per hex while a HEX27 has 27 nodes per hex.
This property is necessary since the element type for his block is SHEL,
and the user may desire a particular hexahedral element type other than HEX8.

Again, the second instance of _CU_UserBlockNo and _CU_NodesPerHex are used 
when the source surface is the source for two volumes swept in opposite
directions.

Name		 EB1	EB2	EB3	EB4	EB5	EB6	EB7	EB8
ID		 100	110	120	130	140	200	210	220
_CU_SweepID1	 1	1	1	1	1	2	2	2
_CU_SweepID2	 0	2	2	0	0	0	0	0
_CU_SurfaceType1 1	3	3	3	2	1	3	2
_CU_SurfaceType2 0	3	3	0	0	0	0	0
_CU_NumberHexes1 125    0       0       0       0       125     0       0
_CU_NumberHexes2 0      0       0       0       0       0       0       0
_CU_UserBlockNo1 100    0       0       0       0       200     0       0
_CU_UserBlockNo2 0      0       0       0       0       0       0       0
_CU_NodesPerHex1 8      0       0       0       0       9       0       0
_CU_NodesPerHex2 0      0       0       0       0       0       0       0

In the example table above, sweepable volume 1 consists of source surface
(block 100), linking surfaces (blocks 110, 120, 130) and target surface
(block 140). Sweepable volume 2 is formed from source surface (block 200),
linking surfaces (blocks 210, 110, 120), and target surface (block 220).
Linking surfaces (blocks 110, 120) are shared by the two volumes. There
are 125 hexes in each of the volumes. This model shares linking surface
but not source surfaces so _CU_NumHexes2 is not used.

The user did not assign block numbers so the default values are used for
_CU_UserBlockNo. If the user had assigned both volume 1 and 2 to block 50,
then the _CU_UserBlockNo1 for EB1 and EB6 would be 50. The number of nodes per
hex for the generated hexes will be 8 for block 100 and 9 for block 200.
The second instance of _CU_UserBlockNo2 and _CU_NodesPerHex2 are not needed
because the source surfaces are independent.
