This directory (./pcamal_test) contains a test of the pCAMAL ExodusII file
format as an interface to the CAMAL sweeper. This is a serial implementation
only.

The following commands will build the test program. (NOTE: pcamal_test
requires updated version of the CAMAL libraries. pcamal_test complains of
missing class methods, you do not have the latest libraries.)

1) mkdir build

2) cd build

3) ccmake ../src
	select the desired options and configure

4) make

You should now have pcamal_test in your build directory.

To generate the swept mesh from bisected_cyl.pcamal.g, do the following in
the build directory.

1) cp ../../bisected_cyl_pcamal.g .

2) ./pcamal_test -i bisected_cyl.pcamal.g -o bisected.sweep

You should see two additional files in the build directory, 
bisected.sweep.vol001.g and bisected.sweep.vol002.g. These two files contain
the hex mesh for each half of the thick walled cylinder.

You can look at them in Cubit if you import the ACIS file, bisected_cyl.sat,
and then import both meshes with the "import mesh" command.
